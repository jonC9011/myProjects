Welcome to the Hip Hop ConnXion member website! This is where you will find out and get to know some of the memebers from the team. Get to know their postion, how long they have been on the team, as well as getting know their dance style! Hip Hop ConnXion (HHC) is a Chicago-based hip hop company that was created back in 1999 by Suavé ConnXion.
It started out as a competitive team over the span of a decade, and has now transformed into a performance team. Many dancers have trained under Suavé and have left making a name for themselves in the dance community. This company is also partnered with the DEA creating a program by helping kids to be influenced by the art of dance to lead
them into the right path away from the harsh realiites that will come in their lifetimes. This company is based in the Aurora-Wheeling locations but have also branched out to other locations such as Indiana, Michigan, and downtown Chicago. Now that you know a little bit about the team over, it's time to get to know the members!
