## LAB 1 FEEDBACK

Hello Jonathon,

This is an awesome submission. This definitely feels like it could
be a site (albeit a small one) that I could visit on the internet.
It's nice to see that you really went for a cohesive style and format
for the site. I changed the folder structure a bit to make sure it matches the expectation.
All of your lab work should be in a lab_# folder at the root of the repository.
I think you probably took my week_2 folder that I used in lecture as the way that you should do that lab.
You do not need a week_# folder, just the lab\_# folder. If you choose to include a sandbox or something like that,
that is fine. It should be completely separate from the lab folders.
